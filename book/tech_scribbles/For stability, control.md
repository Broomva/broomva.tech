# For stability, control

For stability,

Phase margin > 0. Good value: 45 - 60 deg

Gain margin > 0. Good value: 5 - 10 dBs

Phase margin: Measured as the difference between the phase angle and -180Â° when the magnitude of the open loop system crosses 0dBs.

Gain margin: Indicates how much the gain at the phase crossover frequency can be increased before the system is driven to instability
