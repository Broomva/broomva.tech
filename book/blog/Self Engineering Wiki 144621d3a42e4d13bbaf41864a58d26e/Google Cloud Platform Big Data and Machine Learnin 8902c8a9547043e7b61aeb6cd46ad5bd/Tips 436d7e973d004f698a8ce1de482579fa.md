Now, if you remember your SQL, what's one of the things that you can do to get the most? First, you can do an order by which is going to be a sort, and you can order by the alias as we see here. Now, that you actually can't filter in a where clause by an aliase field because it actually doesn't exist when the query engine goes out and performs that where clause. So keep that in mind. That's where you can use things like temporary tables.
