Attribute,SSD,HDD
Power Draw / Battery Life,"Less power draw, averages 2 – 3 watts, resulting in 30+ minute battery boost	","More power draw, averages 6 – 7 watts and therefore uses more battery"
Cost,"Expensive, roughly $0.20 per gigabyte (based on buying a 1TB drive)	","Only around $0.03 per gigabyte, very cheap (buying a 4TB model)"
Capacity,Typically not larger than 1TB for notebook size drives; 4TB max for desktops	,Typically around 500GB and 2TB maximum for notebook size drives; 10TB max for desktops
Operating System Boot Time,Around 10-13 seconds average bootup time	,Around 30-40 seconds average bootup time
Vibration,No vibration as there are no moving parts	,The spinning of the platters can sometimes result in vibration
Heat Produced,Lower power draw and no moving parts so little heat is produced	,"HDD doesn’t produce much heat, but it will have a measurable amount more heat than an SSD due to moving parts and higher power draw"
Failure Rate,Mean time between failure rate of 2.0 million hours	,Mean time between failure rate of 1.5 million hours
File Copy / Write Speed,Generally above 200 MB/s and up to 550 MB/s for cutting edge drives	,The range can be anywhere from 50 – 120MB / s
Encryption,Full Disk Encryption (FDE) Supported on some models	,Full Disk Encryption (FDE) Supported on some models
File Opening Speed,Up to 30% faster than HDD	,Slower than SSD
Magnetism Affected?,An SSD is safe from any effects of magnetism	,Magnets can erase data
