# Data link

Protocol Data Unit: Frame
Function: Reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer
Example: Medium access control (MAC) layer – responsible for controlling how devices in a network gain access to a medium and permission to transmit data.
Logical link control (LLC) layer – responsible for identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols, and controls error checking and frame synchronization.
