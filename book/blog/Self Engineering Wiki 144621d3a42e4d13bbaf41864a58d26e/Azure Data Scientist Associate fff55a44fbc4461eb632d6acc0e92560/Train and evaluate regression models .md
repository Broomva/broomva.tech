# Train and evaluate regression models

Propietario: Carlos Escobar

# ****What is regression?****

Regression works by establishing a relationship between variables in the data that represent characteristics—known as the *features*—of the thing being observed, and the variable we're trying to predict—known as the *label*. Recall our company that rents bicycles and wants to predict the expected number of rentals in a given day. In this case, features include things like the day of the week, month, and so on, while the label is the number of bicycle rentals.

To train the model, we start with a data sample containing the features, as well as known values for the label - so in this case we need historical data that includes dates, weather conditions, and the number of bicycle rentals.

We'll then split this data sample into two subsets:

- A *training* dataset to which we'll apply an algorithm that determines a function encapsulating the relationship between the feature values and the known label values.
- A *validation* or *test* dataset that we can use to evaluate the model by using it to generate predictions for the label and comparing them to the actual known label values.

The use of historic data with known label values to train a model makes regression an example of *supervised* machine learning.

There are various ways we can measure the variance between the predicted and actual values, and we can use these metrics to evaluate how well the model predicts.

**Note**

Machine learning is based in statistics and math, and it's important to be aware of specific terms that statisticians and mathematicians (and therefore data scientists) use. You can think of the difference between a *predicted* label value and the *actual* label value as a measure of ***error***. However, in practice, the "actual" values are based on sample observations (which themselves may be subject to some random variance). To make it clear that we're comparing a *predicted* value (*ŷ*) with an *observed* value (*y*) we refer to the difference between them as the ***residuals***. We can summarize the residuals for all of the validation data predictions to calculate the overall ***loss*** in the model as a measure of its predictive performance.

One of the most common ways to measure the loss is to square the individual residuals, sum the squares, and calculate the mean. Squaring the residuals has the effect of basing the calculation on *absolute* values (ignoring whether the difference is negative or positive) and giving more weight to larger differences. This metric is called the ***Mean Squared Error***.

So is that any good? It's difficult to tell because MSE value isn't expressed in a meaningful unit of measurement. We do know that the lower the value is, the less loss there is in the model; and therefore, the better it is predicting. This makes it a useful metric to compare two models and find the one that performs best.

Sometimes, it's more useful to express the loss in the same unit of measurement as the predicted label value itself. It's possible to do this by calculating the square root of the MSE, which produces a metric known, unsurprisingly, as the ***Root Mean Squared Error*** (RMSE).

There are many other metrics that can be used to measure loss in a regression. For example, **R2 (R Squared)** (sometimes known as *coefficient of determination*) is the correlation between ***x*** and ***y*** squared. This produces a value between 0 and 1 that measures the amount of variance that can be explained by the model. Generally, the closer this value is to 1, the better the model predicts.

# **Regression**

*Supervised* machine learning techniques involve training a model to operate on a set of *features* and predict a *label* using a dataset that includes some already-known label values. The training process *fits* the features to the known labels to define a general function that can be applied to new features for which the labels are unknown, and predict them. You can think of this function like this, in which ***y*** represents the label we want to predict and ***x*** represents the features the model uses to predict it.

$$
y = f(x)
$$

In most cases, *x* is actually a *vector* that consists of multiple feature values, so to be a little more precise, the function could be expressed like this:

$$
y = f([x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n])
$$

The goal of training the model is to find a function that performs some kind of calculation to the *x* values that produces the result *y*. We do this by applying a machine learning *algorithm* that tries to fit the *x* values to a calculation that produces *y* reasonably accurately for all of the cases in the training dataset.

There are lots of machine learning algorithms for supervised learning, and they can be broadly divided into two types:

- ***Regression* algorithms**: Algorithms that predict a *y* value that is a numeric value, such as the price of a house or the number of sales transactions.
- ***Classification* algorithms**: Algorithms that predict to which category, or *class*, an observation belongs. The *y* value in a classification model is a vector of probability values between 0 and 1, one for each class, indicating the probability of the observation belonging to each class.

## **Explore the Data**

The first step in any machine learning project is to explore the data that you will use to train a model. The goal of this exploration is to try to understand the relationships between its attributes; in particular, any apparent correlation between the *features* and the *label* your model will try to predict. This may require some work to detect and fix issues in the data (such as dealing with missing values, errors, or outlier values), deriving new feature columns by transforming or combining existing features (a process known as *feature engineering*), *normalizing* numeric features (values you can measure or count) so they're on a similar scale, and *encoding* categorical features (values that represent discrete categories) as numeric indicators.

# **Improve models with hyperparameters**

Simple models with small datasets can often be fit in a single step, while larger datasets and more complex models must be fit by repeatedly using the model with training data and comparing the output with the expected label. If the prediction is accurate enough, we consider the model trained. If not, we adjust the model slightly and loop again.

Hyperparameters are values that change the way that the model is fit during these loops. Learning rate, for example, is a hyperparameter that sets how much a model is adjusted during each training cycle. A high learning rate means a model can be trained faster, but if it’s too high the adjustments can be so large that the model is never ‘finely tuned’ and not optimal.

## **Preprocessing data**

Preprocessing refers to changes you make to your data before it is passed to the model. We have previously read that preprocessing can involve cleaning your dataset. While this is important, preprocessing can also include changing the format of your data, so it's easier for the model to use. For example, data described as ‘red’, ‘orange’, ‘yellow’, ‘lime’, and ‘green’, may work better if converted into a format more native to computers, such as numbers stating the amount of red and the amount of green.

### **Scaling features**

The most common preprocessing step is to scale features so they fall between zero and one. For example, the weight of a bike and the distance a person travels on a bike may be two very different numbers, but by scaling both numbers to between zero and one allows models to learn more effectively from the data.

### **Using categories as features**

In machine learning, you can also use categorical features such as 'bicycle', 'skateboard’ or 'car'. These features are represented by 0 or 1 values in **one-hot vectors** - vectors that have a 0 or 1 for each possible value. For example, bicycle, skateboard, and car might respectively be (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1).

> Recall that a Gradient Boosting estimator, is like a Random Forest algorithm, but instead of building them all trees independently and taking the average result, each tree is built on the outputs of the previous one in an attempt to incrementally reduce the *loss*
 (error) in the model.

## **Optimize Hyperparameters**

Take a look at the **GradientBoostingRegressor** estimator definition in the output above, and note that it, like the other estimators we tried previously, includes a large number of parameters that control the way the model is trained. In machine learning, the term *parameters* refers to values that can be determined from data; values that you specify to affect the behavior of a training algorithm are more correctly referred to as *hyperparameters*.

The specific hyperparameters for an estimator vary based on the algorithm that the estimator encapsulates. In the case of the **GradientBoostingRegressor** estimator, the algorithm is an ensemble that combines multiple decision trees to create an overall predictive model. You can learn about the hyperparameters for this estimator in the [Scikit-Learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html).

We won't go into the details of each hyperparameter here, but they work together to affect the way the algorithm trains a model. In many cases, the default values provided by Scikit-Learn will work well; but there may be some advantage in modifying hyperparameters to get better predictive performance or reduce training time.

So how do you know what hyperparameter values you should use? Well, in the absence of a deep understanding of how the underlying algorithm works, you'll need to experiment. Fortunately, SciKit-Learn provides a way to *tune* hyperparameters by trying multiple combinations and finding the best result for a given performance metric.

## **Preprocess the Data**

We trained a model with data that was loaded straight from a source file, with only moderately successful results.

In practice, it's common to perform some preprocessing of the data to make it easier for the algorithm to fit a model to it. There's a huge range of preprocessing transformations you can perform to get your data ready for modeling, but we'll limit ourselves to a few common techniques:

### **Scaling numeric features**

Normalizing numeric features so they're on the same scale prevents features with large values from producing coefficients that disproportionately affect the predictions.

There are multiple ways you can scale numeric data, such as calculating the minimum and maximum values for each column and assigning a proportional value between 0 and 1, or by using the mean and standard deviation of a normally distributed variable to maintain the same *spread*
 of values on a different scale.

### **Encoding categorical variables**

Machine learning models work best with numeric features rather than text values, so you generally need to convert categorical features into numeric representations. You can apply *ordinal encoding*
 to substitute a unique integer value for each category. Another common technique is to use *one hot encoding* to create individual binary (0 or 1) features for each possible category value

To apply these preprocessing transformations to the bike rental, we'll make use of a Scikit-Learn feature named *pipelines*. These enable us to define a set of preprocessing steps that end with an algorithm. You can then fit the entire pipeline to the data, so that the model encapsulates all of the preprocessing steps as well as the regression algorithm. This is useful, because when we want to use the model to predict values from new data, we need to apply the same transformations (based on the same statistical distributions and category encodings used with the training data).

> Note: The term pipeline is used extensively in machine learning, often to mean very different things! In this context, we're using it to refer to pipeline objects in Scikit-Learn, but you may see it used elsewhere to mean something else.
